                                            Footprinting is the process of accumulating data regarding a specific
                                            network environment, usually for the purpose of finding ways to intrude into
                                            the environment. Footprinting can reveal system vulnerabilities and improve
                                            the ease with which they can be exploited. It is also known as

                                            The strength of RSA is the difficulty of factoring large integers that are
                                            the product of two large prime numbers, which is considered infeasible due
